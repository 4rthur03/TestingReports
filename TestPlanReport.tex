	\section{Introduction}
		Testing is an important part of development, whether it is software or hardware. Unfortunately, not many developers went out their way to test their product. Testing can be highly time consuming and expensive. However, it is still an essential part of development of a product. Therefore, this paper will present my test plan for this semester. This paper will outline the process of testing the functionality of software.
	\section{Acquired Resources}
		Resources needed to perform the test:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item A computer.
				\item IDE to run the code.
				\item Arthur's brain.
				\item I will use one of the free testing tools online (ASK Sieg)
			\end{itemize}
